                <h2>Robotics</h2>
                <p>
                I am a member of Boise State University's Autonomous Robotic Systems team, which competes in the <a href="http://www.igvc.org" target="_blank">Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition</a>.<br>
                This semester, with the help of more senior teammates, I have been working on our robot's pathfinding code. The robot itself runs on ROS, which gives us a fair amount of boiler plate to start with.<br>
                I've been learning a lot about ROS, as well as the different pathfinding algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's.

                <h2>Classes</h2>
                <p>
                At Boise State University, I have taken Computer Science 2, Intro Systems Programming, and Intro to Version Control so far. These classes all had numerous assignments and projects that have allowed me to practice and apply what is taught in lecture.<br>
                I have implemented linked lists, double linked lists, and both breadth-first and depth-first searches.<br>
                As these projects are somewhat class specific, they not publically posted due to academic integrity concerns.

                This website was 100% hand made from scratch with only HTML and CSS, no frameworks or the like.<br>
                Front end work isn't my strong point by any means, but I know enough to get by.
